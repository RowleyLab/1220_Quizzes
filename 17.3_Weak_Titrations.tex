		{\large	Quiz 17.3 -- Weak Acid/Base Titrations}
	\end{center}
	{\large Name: \rule[-1mm]{4in}{.1pt} 

	\noindent These questions concern titrating a solution of \ch{KNO2} with \ch{NaOH}. $25.00~ml$ of the \ch{KNO2} solution with unknown concentration are placed in an Erlenmeyer flask, and a burette is filled with a $0.575~M$ solution of \ch{NaOH}
	\subsection*{Question 1}
	\ch{NaOH} is added slowly while the $pH$ is monitored. How will you know when the equivalence point of the titration has been reached?
	
	\vspace{1em}
	\subsection*{Question 2}
	The equivalence point is reached after $23.42~ml$ of the base have been added. \\What was the initial acid concentration?
	
	\vspace{2em}
	\subsection*{Question 3}
	Now that you know the initial concentration, calculate what the $pH$ should have been before any base was added
	
	\vspace{3em}
	\subsection*{Question 4}
	What is the $pH$ at the equivalence point, and which acid/base indicator would be appropriate for identifying the end-point in a titrations without a $pH$ meter?
	
	\vspace{3em}
	\subsection*{Question 5}
	What will the $pH$ be after $11.71~ml$ of \ch{NaOH} have been added?	
	
	\vspace{3em}
	\subsection*{Question 6}
	What will the $pH$ be after you have added $23.67~ml$ and $23.17~ml$ of the \ch{NaOH} solution
	
	\vspace{6em}
	\subsection*{Question 7}
	On the back of this page, sketch the titration curve, noting the pH at the most important points

\section*{\emph{Pioneers}}
\paragraph{By Carol Lynn Pearson}~
\begin{verse}
	My people were Mormon pioneers.\\	
	Is the blood still good?\\	
	They stood in awe as truth\\
	Flew by like a dove\\
	And dropped a feather in the West.\\
	Where truth flies you follow\\	
	If you are a pioneer.\\
	I have searched the skies\\
	And now and then\\
	Another feather has fallen.\\
	I have packed the handcart again\\	
	Packed it with the precious things\\
	And thrown away the rest.\\
	I will sing by the fires at night\\	
	Out there on uncharted ground\\
	Where I am my own captain of tens\\	
	Where I blow the bugle\\
	Bring myself to morning prayer\\
	Map out the miles\\
	And never know when or where\\
	Or if at all I will finally say,\\
	“This is the place,”\\
	I face the plains\\
	On a good day for walking.\\
	The sun rises\\
	And the mist clears.\\
	I will be all right:\\
	My people were Mormon Pioneers.
