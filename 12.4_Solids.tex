	\subsection*{Question 1}
	Classify the following solids in as many ways as you can:
	
	\noindent {\large Quartz Crystal \hspace{3em} Naphthalene \hspace{3em} Aluminum Foil \hspace{3em} Glass \hspace{3em} Iron(III) Oxide}

	\subsection*{Question 2}
	At room temperature, iron has a body-centered cubic structure. Iron atoms have a radius of $126~pm$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Give the coordination number of the iron atoms
		\item Find the length of the edge of a unit cell
		\item Estimate the density of iron metal. $\left(\vphantom{\dfrac{g}{cm^3}}\right.$The observed value is $\left.7.87~\dfrac{g}{cm^3}\right)$
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection*{Question 3}
	Lead has a face-centered cubic structure, and a density of $11.34~\dfrac{g}{cm^3}$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Give the coordination number of the lead atoms
		\item Find the length of the edge of a unit cell
		\item Estimate lead's atomic radius. $\left(\vphantom{pm}\right.$The observed value is $\left.175~pm\right)$

	\paragraph{By Maya Angelou}~
	\begin{verse}
		A free bird leaps\\
		on the back of the wind\\
		and floats downstream\\ 
		till the current ends\\
		and dips his wing\\
		in the orange sun rays\\
		and dares to claim the sky.
		
		But a bird that stalks\\
		down his narrow cage\\
		can seldom see through\\
		his bars of rage\\
		his wings are clipped and\\
		his feet are tied\\
		so he opens his throat to sing.
		
		The caged bird sings\\
		with a fearful trill\\ 
		of things unknown\\
		but longed for still\\
		and his tune is heard\\
		on the distant hill\\
		for the caged bird\\
		sings of freedom.
		
		The free bird thinks of another breeze\\
		and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees\\
		and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn\\
		and he names the sky his own
		
		But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams\\
		his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream\\
		his wings are clipped and his feet are tied\\
		so he opens his throat to sing.\\
		
		The caged bird sings\\
		with a fearful trill\\ 
		of things unknown\\
		but longed for still\\
		and his tune is heard\\
		on the distant hill\\
		for the caged bird\\
		sings of freedom.\\
