	\subsection*{Question 1}
	Radioactive decay follows \nth{1}-order kinetics \\Give the rate constant or half-life of the following radioactive elements
	
	\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
		Element & Half-life & Rate Constant $\left(\dfrac{1}{s}\right)$\\ \midrule
		\ch{^{14}C} & $5730~y$ & \hspace{6em} \\ \midrule
		\ch{^{57}Co} & \hspace{6em} & $2.95\times10^{-8}$ \\ \midrule
		\ch{^{99}Tc} & $6.0~h$ & \hspace{6em} \\ \midrule
		\ch{^{218}Po} & \hspace{6em} & $0.00373$ \\ \midrule
		\ch{^{3}H} & $12.3~y$ & \hspace{6em}
	\end{tabular}
	
	\subsection*{Question 2}
	For each order of reaction, will the half-life increase, decrease, or stay constant over the course of a reaction?

	\subsection*{Question 3}
	Use the data provided by email to determine the rate constant, overall reaction order, and reaction order with respect to each reactant in the reaction:

	\paragraph{By Rudyard Kippling}~
	\begin{verse}
		If you can keep your head when all about you\\
		\hspace{0.5em} Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,\\
		If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\\
		\hspace{0.5em} But make allowance for their doubting too;\\
		If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\\
		\hspace{0.5em} Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,\\
		Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,\\
		\hspace{0.5em} And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
		
		If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;\\
		\hspace{0.5em} If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;\\
		If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\\
		\hspace{0.5em} And treat those two impostors just the same;\\
		If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken\\
		\hspace{0.5em} Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\\
		Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,\\
		\hspace{0.5em} And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
		
		If you can make one heap of all your winnings\\
		\hspace{0.5em} And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\\
		And lose, and start again at your beginnings\\
		\hspace{0.5em} And never breathe a word about your loss;\\
		If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\\
		\hspace{0.5em} To serve your turn long after they are gone,\\
		And so hold on when there is nothing in you\\
		\hspace{0.5em} Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’
		
		If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\\
		\hspace{0.5em} Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,\\
		If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\\
		\hspace{0.5em} If all men count with you, but none too much;\\
		If you can fill the unforgiving minute\\
		\hspace{0.5em} With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,\\
		Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,\\
		\hspace{0.5em} And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
	\end{verse}
