	\subsection*{Question 1}
	Consider the decomposition of ozone: \ch{2 O3(g) -> 3 O2(g)} \hspace{1em} $\Delta H_{rxn} = -185.4~\dfrac{kJ}{mol}$
	
	\noindent With the following proposed mechanism:
	
	\ch{O3(g) <=> O2(g) + O(g)} \hspace{1em} FAST
	
	\ch{O(g) + O3(g) -> 2 O2(g)} \hspace{1em} SLOW
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Does this mechanism add up to the total overall reaction?
		\item Identify any catalysts or intermediates in this mechansm:
		\item Give the molecularity and the rate law for each elementary step (including the reverse reaction in step 1):
		\item Give the predicted overall rate law for this mechanism:
		\item Draw a plausible reaction coordinate diagram for this reaction
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{7em}
	\subsection*{Question 2}
	Enzymes are biomolecules which catalyze the reaction of a substrate to form products: \ch{S->P}
	
	\noindent Enzymes often follow the \emph{Michaelis-Menton} reaction mechanism:
	
	\ch{E + S <=> ES} \hspace{1em} FAST
	
	\ch{ES -> E + P} \hspace{1em} SLOW
	
	\noindent Answer the same questions above for the Michaelis-Menton mechanism

		People burn the beanstalk to boil beans,\\
		filtering them to extract juice.\\
		The beanstalks were burnt under the cauldron,\\
		and the beans in the cauldron wailed:\\
		“We were originally grown from the same root;\\
		Why should we hound each other to death with such impatience?”
