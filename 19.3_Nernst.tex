\noindent
A cell is constructed which reduces \ch{Pb^{2+}} to \ch{Pb} and oxidizes \ch{Al} to \ch{Al^{3+}} and operated at $25.00~^\circ C$

\subsection*{Question 1}
Find $E^\circ_{cell}$ for this cell

\vspace{2em}
\subsection*{Question 2}
Based on $E^\circ_{cell}$, find $\Delta G^\circ$ for the reaction in this cell

\vspace{6em}
\subsection*{Question 3}
Based on $E^\circ_{cell}$, find $K$ for the reaction in this cell

\vspace{6em}
\subsection*{Question 4}
Find $E$ for this cell if the actual concentrations are: $\left[\ch{Pb^{2+}}\right] = 0.250~M$ and $\left[\ch{Al^{3+}}\right] = 0.125~M$

\vspace{8em}
\subsection*{Question 5}
Will the voltage increase or decrease if the cell is placed in the refrigerator?

\section*{\emph{Good Bones}}
\paragraph{By Maggie Smith}~
\begin{verse}
	Life is short, though I keep this from my children.\\
	Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine\\
	in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,\\
	a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways\\
	I’ll keep from my children. The world is at least\\
	fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative\\
	estimate, though I keep this from my children.\\
	For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.\\
	For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,\\
	sunk in a lake. Life is short and the world\\
	is at least half terrible, and for every kind\\
	stranger, there is one who would break you,\\
	though I keep this from my children. I am trying\\
	to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,\\
	walking you through a real shithole, chirps on\\
	about good bones: This place could be beautiful,\\
	right? You could make this place beautiful.
