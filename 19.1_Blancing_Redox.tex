\subsection*{Question 1}
Balance the following reactions in acidic solution:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \ch{H2O2(aq) + ClO2(aq) -> ClO2^-(aq) + O2(g)}
	
	\vspace{4em}
	\item \ch{Fe^{2+}(aq) + MnO4^-(aq) -> Fe^{3+}(aq) + Mn^{2+}(aq)}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Question 2}
Balance the same reactions in basic solution:

\vspace{10em}
\subsection*{Question 3}
$25.00~ml$ of \ch{Fe(NO3)2} solution are titrated with $13.65~ml$ of acidic $0.103~M$ \ch{KMnO4} solution.\\Find the original $\left[\ch{Fe(NO3)2}\right]$

\section*{\emph{Because I Could Not Stop for Death (479)}}
\paragraph{By Emily Dickinson}~
\begin{verse}
	Because I could not stop for Death –\\
	He kindly stopped for me –\\
	The Carriage held but just Ourselves –\\
	And Immortality.
	
	We slowly drove – He knew no haste\\
	And I had put away\\
	My labor and my leisure too,\\
	For His Civility –
	
	We passed the School, where Children strove\\
	At Recess – in the Ring –\\
	We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –\\
	We passed the Setting Sun –
	
	Or rather – He passed Us –\\
	The Dews drew quivering and Chill –\\
	For only Gossamer, my Gown –\\
	My Tippet – only Tulle –
	
	We paused before a House that seemed\\
	A Swelling of the Ground –\\
	The Roof was scarcely visible –\\
	The Cornice – in the Ground –
	
	Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet\\
	Feels shorter than the Day\\
	I first surmised the Horses' Heads\\
	Were toward Eternity –
\end{verse}
