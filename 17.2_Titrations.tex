		{\large	Quiz 17.2 -- Strong Acid/Base Titrations}
	\end{center}
	{\large Name: \rule[-1mm]{4in}{.1pt} 

	\noindent These questions concern titrating a solution of \ch{HCl} with \ch{NaOH}. $25.00~ml$ of the \ch{HCl} solution with unknown concentration are placed in an Erlenmeyer flask, and a burette is filled with a $0.125~M$ solution of \ch{NaOH}
	\subsection*{Question 1}
	\ch{NaOH} is added slowly while the $pH$ is monitored. How will you know when the equivalence point of the titration has been reached?
	
	\vspace{3em}
	\subsection*{Question 2}
	The equivalence point is reached after $34.65~ml$ of the base have been added. \\What was the initial acid concentration?
	
	\vspace{3em}
	\subsection*{Question 3}
	Now that you know the initial concentration, calculate what the $pH$ should have been before any base was added
	
	\vspace{3em}
	\subsection*{Question 4}
	What will the $pH$ be after you have added $34.40$ and $34.90~ml$ of the \ch{NaOH} solution
	
	\vspace{6em}
	\subsection*{Question 5}
	Sketch the titration curve, noting the pH at the most important points

\paragraph{By Lucille Clifton}~
\begin{verse}
	loaded like spoons\\
	into the belly of Jesus\\
	where we lay for weeks for months\\
	in the sweat and stink\\
	of our own breathing\\
	Jesus\\
	why do you not protect us\\
	chained to the heart of the Angel\\
	where the prayers we never tell\\
	and hot and red\\
	as our bloody ankles\\
	Jesus\\
	Angel\\
	can these be men\\
	who vomit us out from ships\\
	called Jesus    Angel    Grace of God\\
	onto a heathen country\\
	Jesus\\
	Angel\\
	ever again\\
	can this tongue speak\\
	can these bones walk\\
	Grace Of God\\
	can this sin live
